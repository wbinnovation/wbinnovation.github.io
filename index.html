    				<h3><a href="/HOA/HOA1">HOA1</a></h3>
    				<p>It covers approximately 2,000,000 km² (770,000 sq mi) and is inhabited by roughly 100 million people (Ethiopia: 85 million, Somalia: 9.3 million, Eritrea: 5.2 million, and Djibouti: 0.86 million). Regional studies on the Horn of Africa are carried out, among others, in the fields of Ethiopian Studies as well as Somali Studies.</p>
    				<h3><a href="/HOA/HOA2">HOA2</a></h3>
    				<p>The Horn of Africa is almost equidistant from the equator and the Tropic of Cancer. It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a fissure in the Earth's crust extending from Turkey to Mozambique and marking the separation of the African and Arabian tectonic plates. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley, with the highest peaks in the Semien Mountains of northwestern Ethiopia.</p>
    				<h3><a href="/SDI/SDI1">SDI1</a></h3>
    				<p>Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) – a new Africa wide initiative that collects actionable data on service delivery in schools and health facilities has been launched by the World Bank in partnership with the African Economic Research Consortium and the African Development Bank. The SDI data are used to assess the quality and performance of education and health services for decision makers to track progress over time, and for citizens to hold governments accountable for public spending.</p>
